## Contribute!

Contributions are always welcome.  You're welcome to contribute anything, whether documentation or code.

If you're kind of lost on how to contribute, here is a short guide:

1. Make a GitHub account (if you don't have one) -
    GitHub have guidelines for newbies, so make sure to read them if you're lost.
2. Fork the repository
3. Commit your changes to YOUR repository.
4. Create a pull request (Click the pull request button on top of your fork) or
    notify me via e-mail <f.fallen45@gmail.com>
 
**Note**: You do not need to re-fork the project when a new change is made to this repository.  Use the following git commands:
 
```
git remote add https://github.com/decltype/forgottenmapeditor.git upstream
git fetch upstream
```
 
Then whenever a new change is pushed into my repository, just use:
 
```
git pull --rebase upstream master # pull from master branch
```

Alternatively, you can use git pull with the repository URL everytime, but it's quicker to just add the remote. Like so:

```
git pull --rebase https://github.com/decltype/forgottenmapeditor.git master
```

## Short guide for running

Warning: OTClient precompiled binaries may not be up-to-date (They're not updated frequently)!
So some of the new features may not work at all.

You most likely would want to go for a compilation from scratch when you want to test/develop the master branch.

After you have a working executable, place it on top of FME folder then run the executable.
